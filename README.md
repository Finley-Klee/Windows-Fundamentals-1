<p>In the first section of this room I learned a bit of the history of the previous Windows editions as well as information about the differences between the home and pro versions of the current Windows edition - Windows 11.</p>

 Using the information in the comparison table, I was able to answer the question "What encryption can you enable on Pro that you can't enable in Home?" with the name Bitlocker.<br />
